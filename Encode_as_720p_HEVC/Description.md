Functional Overview

1. Right-click target file(s) within macOS Finder
2. Scrolling down to **Quick Actions**, select **Encode as 720p HEVC**, passing your files to the Automator workflow
3. The Automator workflow captures the output from the python script to log successes and failures
4. Also within the Automator script are calls to additional functions to split out various elements for generating Notifications


Any feedback or comments on how to remove dependancy on the additional splitter calls would be really appreciated!
