This is a collection of my custom scripts written to encode (usually) video files using ffmpeg.  
In most cases, my use case is in batch and executed as a Finder Quick Action, complete with encoding results and storage space savings pushed as via a macOS Notification.  
Whenever possible, I will include the associated .workflow file.  

### ** Coming Soon **  

Currently working on an installer script that will put all the pieces into their various locations, with the end result being a fully functional macOS Quick Action service, accessable within Finder's right/alt click menu.
I hope to have the installer finished by mid-November '24.
